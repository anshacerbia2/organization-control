// Package dispatch publishes outbox rows to a consumer over HTTP.
//
// It satisfies `outbox.Publisher`, which is a one-method interface declared by the substrate on the
// consuming side. Which transport carries an event is therefore one adapter, and this is it: a
// broker replaces this file and nothing else.
//
// HTTP first, deliberately. TDD-organization-control-003 leaves the broker open, and choosing one
// is an operational decision the estate has not made. What Proof A needs is a transport whose
// anomalies can be produced on demand — duplicate, reorder, timeout, outage — and a deterministic
// adapter does that better than a real broker, which has to be provoked.

//     unregistered type, a payload it cannot read — so retrying only delays the dead letter and
//     spends the attempt budget of every event behind it.

//     dead-lettering the estate's events because of it would turn a credential rotation into data
//     loss.
